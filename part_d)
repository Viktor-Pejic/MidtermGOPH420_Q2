The answer using dt = 1s for Trapezoid: 334.3304 m/s
The answer using dt = 1s for Simpson's: 331.3916 m/s
The answer using 5-point Gauss-Legendre Integration: 330.5099 m/s

The answers are relatively close to each other with Simpson's and Gauss giving
an answer that are more or less the same. Trapezoid uses linear polynomials
with a minimum of 2 sample points to integrate and Simpson's uses quadratic
polynomials with a minimum of 3 sample points. The result we would expect to be
more accurate is Gauss-legendre as its order of error is h^2n, since we used a 5-point
polynomial to integrate using this method, we would have an error approximation to the
order of 10. Compared to Simpson's which has an order of 4 for the multi application
and order of 2 for multi application Trapezoid integration.
